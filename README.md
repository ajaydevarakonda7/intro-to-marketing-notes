# Introduction to marketing

## Building strong brands
Marketing is the study of an exchange(a market). 

Two types of markets:
| s.no | Buyer's market | Seller's market |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1. | Product focused | Customer focused |
| 2. | We try to give the best we can to the customer and try to reduce prices. | We try to give the customer exactly what he needs and charge premiums. |
| 3. | Persuade the customer to want what the product offers. | Persuade the company to offer what the customer wants. |

Try to please every single customer and you'll go out of business. Marketer has to be transparent, authentic and has to consider the __entire customer experience__.

#### My Own Notes
But the kind of product that I try to build is not much customer focused. 

She also talks about connected community. I do not believe it would be as effective as direct word of mouth. But I've seen some people give advice about some products if they work really well.
