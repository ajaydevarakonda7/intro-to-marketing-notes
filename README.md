# Introduction to marketing

## Building strong brands
Marketing is the study of an exchange(a market). 

#### Buyer's market
Buyer's market is product focused. We try to give the best we can to the customer and try to reduce prices.

#### Seller's market
Seller's market is customer focused. We try to give the customer exactly what he needs and charge premiums.

Try to please every single customer and you'll go out of business. Marketer has to be transparent, authentic and has to consider the __entire customer experience__.

#### 3 Principles
1. Customer value
2. Differentiation
3. Segmenation, Targeting and positioning.

#### 4 P's principles
Product, place, promotion and price = market.

#### My Own Notes
But the kind of product that I try to build is not much customer focused. 

She also talks about connected community. I do not believe it would be as effective as direct word of mouth. But I've seen some people give advice about some products if they work really well.
